# Lab 5 - Exercise 1 - Manage Roles and Permission Policies

In this exercise you will continue in your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s
Messaging Administrator. Holly has been tasked with managing Microsoft 365 admin
roles and permission policies for Adatum’s Microsoft 365 messaging environment.
The CTO has asked Holly to create a new Microsoft 365 management role group that
allows an administrator to remotely access a mailbox without having the
password.

In this exercise Holly will access the Exchange admin center for Exchange Online
from her client computer (LON-CL1).

## Task 1 - Create an Admin Role

A management role group is a universal security group used in the Role Based
Access Control (RBAC) permissions model for Exchange Online. A management role
group simplifies the assignment of management roles to a group of users. All
members of a role group are assigned the same set of roles. After the role group
is added, the members of the role group are granted the permissions provided by
the roles assigned to the role group.

In this task, you are going to create a custom role group and then assign
multiple roles to it. In this task, you will create an admin role that allows an
administrator to remotely access a mailbox without having the password. You will
then assign two specific administrators to this role.

1. Switch to the **LON-CL1** VM and if necessary, log in as the **Administrator**
    with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. The Microsoft Edge browser may still be open from Lab 4 where you were
    logged into Microsoft 365 as a user other than the MOD Administrator
    and you had Compliance center open. Log out of Microsoft 365 and log
    back in as the MOD Administrator account.

3. Close all tabs in the Edge browser except for the **Sign out** tab.

4. On the **Sign out** tab, enter the following URL in the address bar:
    **<https://portal.office.com>**

5. On the **Pick an account** window, select
    **admin@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant
    prefix provided by your lab hosting provider). On the **Enter password**
    window, enter the tenant admin password provided by your lab hosting
    provider and then select **Sign in**.

6. On the **Office 365 home** page, select the **Admin** icon in the column of
    Microsoft 365 app icons on the left-side of the screen.

7. On the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select
    **Show all** in the left-hand navigation pane, and then under **Admin
    centers**, select **Exchange.**

8. In the **Exchange admin center** tab, in the left-hand navigation pane,
    select **Roles.**

9. Then in the expanded group select **admin roles**.

10. The **admin roles** window displays the existing role groups. Each of these
    groups has one or more roles assigned to it.  

    For example, the **Compliance Management** role group is highlighted by
    default as it’s the first group in the list. In the details pane on the
    right-hand side of the screen, it displays the properties for this role
    group, which includes the roles and members that have been assigned to it.
    In this task, you are going to create a custom role group and then assign
    multiple roles to it, as well as several existing members.  
  
    Select the **Add role group** icon on the menu bar to create a new role
    group.

11. In the **add role group** window, enter **Application Impersonation** in the
    **Name** field.

12. Enter (copy and paste) the following text into the **Description** field:
    **This role group allows an administrator to remotely access a mailbox
    without having the mailbox owner’s password.**

    **Note:** Notice that there is only one option for **write scope**, Default. This is because you have not created a management scope in your tenant yet. Management role scopes enable you to define the specific scope of impact or influence of a management role when a management role assignment is created. When you apply a scope, the role assignee assigned to the role can only modify the objects contained within that scope. For the purpose of this lab, defining a scope is not needed.

    Select **Next** to proceed.

13. Under **Add permissions** section, either scroll or search for the following roles and select them:

    - **ApplicationImpersonation**

    - **Mail Recipients**

14. Select the **Next** button,

15. In the **Assign admins** window, in the **Members** section
    Enter the following then select the names:

    - **MOD Admin**

    - **Global Administrator** - TenantAdmins_-########## (where ########## represents
        the tenant number at the end of the TenantAdmins group)

16. Select the **Next** button.

17. In the **Review role group and finish** section, confirm that all the information is present and select the  **Add role group** button.

18. The page will return a notification screen stating, **Application Impersonation role group has been added**. select the **Done** button.

19. Next we will use Exchange PowerShell to add a 3rd role to the RoleGroup we just created. While still on LON-CL1, open an elevated instance of **Windows PowerShell**. Select the magnifying glass (Search) icon on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen ad type **powershell** in the Search box that appears. In the list of search results, right-click on **Windows PowerShell** (do NOT select Windows PowerShell ISE) and select **Run as administrator** in the drop-down menu.

20. Maximize your PowerShell window. In Windows PowerShell, at the command prompt, type the following command and press **Enter**:

    `Connect-ExchangeOnline`

21. A **Microsoft 365 Sign in** window will appear. Enter in the username for
    the **Mod Administrator** account provided by your learning provider
    (admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com) and then select **Next**.

22. In the **Enter password** window, enter the password for this admin account
    provided by your learning provider, and then select **Sign in**. It may take
    a moment to sign in before it returns a command prompt.

23. You will now add the Role **UserApplication** to the **Application Impersonation** RoleGroup. At the command prompt, type the following command and press **Enter**:

    `New-ManagementRoleAssignment -SecurityGroup "Application Impersonation" -Role UserApplication`

24. To verify the new role was added successfully, type the following command and press **Enter**:

    `Get-RoleGroup "Application Impersonation" | FL`

    Examine the output and verify roles now displays **{ApplicationImpersonation, Mail Recipients, UserApplication}** and then close the PowerShell window.

25. Leave the Exchange Admin Center open in your Edge browser and proceed to the next task.

## Task 2 - Manage an Admin Role

In the prior task, you created a custom role group and added roles to the role
group. In this task, you are going to add a user to a role group.

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **Administrator** account
    with a password of **Pa55w.rd**; however, if the log-in screen appears, then
    log in now.

2. The **Exchange admin center** for Exchange Online should still be open in your Edge browser, which should be displaying the **admin roles** tab from the prior task. In the list of admin role groups, select the **Discovery Management** role
    group.

3. The **Discovery Management** pane will open. Select the **Assigned** tab.

4. In the **Assigned** window, select the  **(+) Add** button.

5. In the **Add admins** window, Enter **admin** inside the search field.(this is the MOD
    Administrator user account).

6. Select the **Mod Administrator** account and then select **Add**.

7. In the **Assigned** tab displays a banner  stating that **1 member added to this role group.** select the **X** to close the **Discovery Management** pane.

8. Leave the Exchange Admin Center open in your Edge browser and proceed to the next task.

## Task 3 - Create an Outlook on the web policy

In Exchange Online, Outlook on the web mailbox policies control the availability of settings and features in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App). A mailbox can only have one Outlook on the web mailbox policy applied to it. You can create different policies for different types of users in your Exchange Online organization.

**Note:** All mailbox policies set for Outlook on the web will also affect the new Outlook for Windows.

In this task, you will create a new Outlook Web policy that will later be
assigned to several test users in Holly’s pilot project.

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **Administrator** account
    with a password of **Pa55w.rd**; however, if the log-in screen appears, then
    log in now.

2. The **Exchange admin center** for Exchange Online should still be open in your Edge browser. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Roles** and in the expanded group, select **Outlook web app policies**.

3. On the **Outlook web app policies** web page that appears, Note that the **OwaMailboxPolicy-Default** policy is the only current policy. By default, this policy is assigned to all user mailboxes.

4. To create a new Outlook Web App policy, select **New OWA Policy** from the menu bar.

5. In the **new Outlook Web App mailbox policy** window, enter **Test OWA
    Mailbox policy** in the **Policy name** field and then select **Next**.

6. In the **Communication Management** group, all features are selected by
    default. Select the **Text Messaging** check box to unselect it.

7. In the **Information management** group, un-check **Journaling**.

8. In the **User experience** group, select **Places** and **Local events**.

9. Select **Next**.

10. Leave the default options for **Public or shared computers** & **Private computers** selected and then select **Next**.

11. Review your policy and ensure all settings are correct. Once finished, select **Create**. Once **Outlook we app policy succesfull!** appears, select **Done.**

12. Leave the Edge browser and all tabs open and proceed to the next exercise.

## Task 4 - Assign an Outlook on the web policy to a user mailbox

Assigning an Outlook on the web mailbox policy to an Exchange Online mailbox
controls the Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App, or OWA)
experience for the user. You can apply Outlook on the web mailbox policies to
one or more mailboxes or remove the policy assignments in the Exchange admin
center (EAC) or Exchange Online PowerShell.

In this task, you are going to assign the Outlook on the web policy that you
created in the prior task to a mailbox that is part of Holly’s pilot project.

1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **Administrator** account
    with a password of **Pa55w.rd**; however, if the log-in screen appears, then
    log in now.

2. The **Exchange admin center** for Exchange Online should still be open in your Edge browser. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Recipients** and in the expanded group, select **Mailboxes**.

3. The prior task indicated that by default, all user mailboxes are assigned
    the **OwaMailboxPolicy-Default** policy. Let’s verify this before assigning
    the new policy to one of the user mailboxes. In the list of Microsoft 365
    user account mailboxes that were created by your lab hosting provider,
    select **Joni Sherman**.

4. A new window should open displaying **Joni Serhman's** mailbox properties. By default the **General** tab should be selected. Take a moment to review the various properties.

5. While still on the **General** tab, under **Email apps & mobile devices** select the **Manage email apps settings** hyperlink.

6. On the new window that appears, at the bottum under **Outlook web app mailbox policy** Notice that **OwaMailboxPolicy-Default** is displayed.

7. You will now assign the Outlook Web App mailbox policy that you created in the prior task to **Joni Sherman**

8. With the **Manage settings for email apps** page still open, select the **X** to the right of **OWaMailboxPolicy-Default**.

9. Click into the field with the text **Select the Outlook web app mailbox policy** displayed, and then start typing **Test OWA**. From the list of suggested results, select **Test OWA Mailobx Policy**.

10. Select **Save**. Once **Email app settings updated successfully** is displayed, select the **X** icon in the top right hand corner to exit.

11. Leave the Edge browser and all tabs open and proceed to the next lab.
