# Module 8 - Lab 8 - Exercise 1 - Create Public Folders

Holly Dickson wants to continue reviewing the messaging functionality in
Microsoft 365, and more specifically, the use of public folders. In this lab,
you will log into the Exchange admin center for Exchange Online and create a
public folder mailbox and a public folder in Microsoft 365.

Public folder mailboxes contain the hierarchy information plus the content for
public folders. The first public folder mailbox you create will be the primary
hierarchy mailbox, which contains the only writable copy of the hierarchy. Any
additional public folder mailboxes you create will be secondary mailboxes, which
contain a read-only copy of the hierarchy.

Public folders are designed for shared access and provide an easy and effective
way to collect, organize, and share information with other people in your
workgroup or organization. You can't create a public folder unless you've first
created a public folder mailbox.

## Task 1 - Create a Public Folder Mailbox

In this task, you will create a public folder mailbox as part of Holly’s
Microsoft 365 pilot project. Every public folder must be contained in a public
folder mailbox; therefore, you must create the public folder mailbox first
before you can create a public folder.

1.  You should still be logged into LON-CL1 from the prior lab; if necessary,
    log in as the **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  In the Edge browser, the Office 365 home page, the Microsoft 365 admin
    center, and the Exchange admin center tabs should still be open. Select the
    **Exchange admin center** tab (if you have both the classic EAC and the New
    EAC open, select the classic EAC; public folders have not yet been added to
    the New EAC).

3.  In the **Exchange admin center**, on the left-hand navigation pane, select
    **public folders**.

4.  At the top of the **public folders** page, select the **public folder
    mailboxes** tab.

5.  On the **public folder mailboxes** tab, select the **plus (+) sign** icon on
    the menu bar to add a new public folder mailbox.

6.  In the **new public folder mailbox** window, enter **Test PF mailbox1** in
    the **Name** field, select **Save**, and then select **OK** once the
    information is successfully saved.

7.  This will return you to the **public folder mailboxes** list, which should
    now display **Test PF mailbox1**.

8.  Leave all browser tabs open and proceed to the next task.

## Task 2 - Create a Public Folder

Now that you have created a public folder mailbox, you can create a public
folder. When using the EAC to create a public folder, you'll only be able to set
the name and the path of the public folder. To configure additional settings,
you'll need to edit the public folder after it's created (which you will do in
the next lab exercise).

1.  You should still be in LON-CL1 and you should be in the **Exchange admin
    center** tab in your browser.

2.  In the **Exchange admin center**, you should still be in the **public
    folders** page, and you should be in the **public folder mailboxes** tab
    after having completed the prior task.  
      
    Since you now want to create a public folder, select the **public folders**
    tab at the top of the page.

3.  In the **public folders** tab, select the **plus (+) sign** icon to add a
    new public folder.

4.  In the **new public folder** window, enter **Test PF1** in the **Name**
    field, select **Save,** and then select **OK** once the information is
    successfully saved.

5.  This will return you to the **public folder** list, which should now display
    **Test PF1**.

6.  Leave all browser tabs open and proceed to the next lab exercise, where you
    will enable mail settings for this **Test PF1** public folder.
