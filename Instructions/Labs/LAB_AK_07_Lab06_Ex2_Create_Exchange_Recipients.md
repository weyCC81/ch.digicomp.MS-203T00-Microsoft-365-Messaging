# Module 7 – Lab 6 - Exercise 2 – Create Exchange Recipients

Adatum Corporation plans to create a hybrid Exchange deployment. They have
Exchange Server 2019 and their on-premises user mailboxes installed on their
on-premises Exchange Server (LON-EX1). Now that they are implementing Microsoft
365, they can also create user accounts and mailboxes in Exchange Online.

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator, you are
interested in seeing how mailboxes are maintained in both Adatum’s on-premises
Exchange Server deployment as well as its new Microsoft 365 deployment. In this lab, you will create several recipient mailboxes in Exchange On-Prem as well as an Exchange Online user mailbox for Holly, which will be added to the
**xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** domain (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix
provided by your lab hosting provider).

## Task 1 - Create Recipient mailboxes (on-premises)

In this task, you will create several recipient
mailboxes in the on-premises Exchange admin center (EAC) on the Exchange Server
(LON-EX1) VM. Holly Dickson, Adatum’s new Messaging administrator, has decided to create on-premises mailboxes for herself and two new team employees, Paul Wimmer and Jessica Hofer.

1. Switch to **LON-EX1** where you should already be logged in as the
    **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd** from the Lab 1 exercise.

2. To create on-premises user mailboxes, you must open the on-premises Exchange
    admin center for Exchange Server 2019. To do so, select the **Start** icon
    on the taskbar, and in the Start menu select the **Microsoft Exchange Server
    2019** group. In the program group, select **Exchange Administrative
    Center**.

3. This will open the **Edge** browser, which will display the sign-in page for
    the **Exchange admin center**. Sign into the EAC as
    **adatum\\Administrator** and password **Pa55w.rd.**

4. In the **Exchange admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select
    **recipients** if necessary (it should be selected by default).

5. On the **recipients** page, the **mailboxes** tab at the top of the page
    should be displayed by default.  

    On the **mailboxes** tab, select the **plus (+) sign** icon and in the
    drop-down menu that appears, select **User mailbox.**

6. In the **new user mailbox** window, enter **hollyD** in the **Alias** field.

7. Select the **New User** option.

8. Enter **Holly** in the **First name** field.

9. Leave the **Initials** field blank.

10. Enter **Dickson** in the **Last name** field.

11. When you tab off the **Last name** field, **Holly Dickson** will be
    automatically displayed in the **Display name** and **Name** fields.

12. For the **Organizational unit** field, select the **Browse** button.

13. In the **select an organizational unit** window, select **Users** and then
    select **OK**.

14. Scroll down in the window and enter **HollyD** in the **User logon name**
    field.  

    **Note:** The domain field (to the right of the **User logon name**) is
    prefilled with **Adatum.com**; this is Adatum’s on-premises domain. Leave
    this set to **Adatum.com**.

15. Enter **User.pw1** in the **New password** and **Confirm password** fields.

16. Make sure the **Require password change on next logon** check box is
    unchecked; if necessary, uncheck it.

17. Select **Save.** The new user mailbox that was created for Holly Dickson
    should be displayed in the list of mailboxes.

18. Repeat steps 5-17 for the following two users:

    - **Paul Wimmer**; alias and user log on name: **PaulW**

    - **Jessica Hofer**; alias and user log on name: **JessicaH**

19. Leave the Exchange admin center open and proceed to the next task.

## Task 2 - Create a Cloud Recipient

In this task you will add a user account for Holly Dickson in Microsoft 365,
which will create a mailbox for Holly in Exchange Online. In your role as Holly
Dickson, you are still logged into Microsoft 365 as the MOD Administrator
account. Holly will create this user account for herself, and she will assign
herself the Exchange Admin role. You will perform this task in the LON-CL1 VM.

1. Switch to LON-CL1 were you should still be logged into as the **Administrator** account
    with a password of **Pa55w.rd**; however, if the log-in screen appears, then
    log in now.

2. In your Edge browser, you should still have tabs open for the **Office 365
    Home** page and the **Microsoft 365 admin center** tab from the prior lab.
    You should also be logged in as the MOD Administrator. If so, then proceed
    to the next step. However, if you closed your browser at the end of the
    prior lab, then navigate to the **Office 365 home** page, log in as
    **admin@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com,** and then navigate to the **Microsoft 365 admin center.**

3. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Users** in the left-hand
    navigation pane, and then in the expanded group select **Active Users.**

4. In the **Active Users** window, note the existing user accounts in the
    **Active Users** list. These accounts were added to Adatum’s Microsoft 365
    tenant by your lab hosting provider. Since Holly is not familiar with adding
    a new user in Microsoft 365, she wants to create a user account for herself.  

    In the menu bar that appears above the list of active users, select **Add a
    user.** This initiates the **Add a user** wizard.

5. In the **Set up the basics** page, enter the following information:

    - First name: **Holly**

    - Last name: **Dickson**

    - Display name: **Holly Dickson**

    - Username: **Holly**

        **IMPORTANT:** To the right of the **Username** field is the domain
        field. It will be prefilled with the **xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**
        cloud domain (where xxxxxZZZZZZ is the tenant prefix provided by your
        lab hosting provider).

        After configuring this field, Holly’s username should appear as:
        **Holly@xxxxxZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**

    - Clear (uncheck) the **Automatically create a password**

    - Password: **User.pw1**

    - Clear (uncheck) the **Require this user to change their password when
        they first sign in** check box

6. Select **Next**.

7. In the **Assign product licenses** page, enter the following information:

    - Select location: **United States**

    - Licenses: Under **Assign user a product license**, select **Office 365 E5**

8. Select **Next.**

9. In the **Optional settings** page, select the drop-down arrow to the right
    of **Roles (User: no administration access).**

10. In the **Roles information** that appears, select the **Admin center
    access** option. By doing so, the most commonly used Microsoft 365
    administrator roles are displayed below this option and are available to be
    assigned.

    **Note:** All the admin roles will be displayed if you select **Show all by
    category**. For Holly, you do not need to view all the admin roles by
    category, since Holly will be assigned the Exchange Admin role that appears
    in this list of most commonly used roles. If you are interested in seeing
    what additional admin roles are available, select **Show all by category**.

11. In the list of most commonly used roles, select **Exchange Administrator** and then
    select **Next**.

12. On the **Review and finish** page, review your selections. If anything needs
    to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** link and make the necessary
    changes. Otherwise, if everything is correct, select **Finish adding**.

13. On the **Holly Dickson added to active users** page, select **Show** that
    appears next to the string of asterisks for the **Password**. Verify that
    the password is **User.pw1** and then select **Close.**

    **Note:** If you accidentally entered a different password, then once you
    return to the **Active Users** page, you must select the **Reset a
    password** icon (the key icon that appears when you hover over Holly's
    account) to change her password to the correct value.

14. You should now see Holly Dickson’s user account in the **Active users**
    list.

15. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation bar,
    select **Show all** to display all the navigation menu options.

16. In the left-hand navigation pane, under the **Admin centers** group, select
    **Exchange**. This will open the EAC for Exchange Online in a new tab in
    your browser.

17. In the **Exchange Admin Center**, in the left-hand navigation pane, select
    **recipients.**

18. Then in the expanded group select **mailboxes**.
    In the list of recipient mailboxes, you should see the Exchange Online
    mailbox that was automatically created for Holly when you created her
    Microsoft 365 user account.

    **Note:** You may need to refresh your browser several times before Holly's exchange mailbox is displayed.

19. Leave your Edge browser open and proceed to the next exercise.
